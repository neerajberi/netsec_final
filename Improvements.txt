1) Correct the bug when a user logs in again from separate terminal. Delete previous entry from server authed database. Other clients should also remove previous data from user table
2) Add a timeout for symmetric keys
3) Add logout mechanism
4) In case client1 is not able to reach client2, delete client2's entry from client1 table
